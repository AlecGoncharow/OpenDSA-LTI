<p>
This guide will help instructors to set up an OpenDSA eTextbook
instance for use within a Canvas course.
If your institution has its own Canvas installation, then you can
attach an OpenDSA eTextbook to any course where you have instructor
permissions.
If you don't have access to Canvas at your institution, then you can
create a Canvas course at the public Canvas site,
<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com">https://canvas.instructure.com</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you are an OpenDSA developer, then you probably want
to set up your own test installation following the directions at
<a href="https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA-DevStack">
https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA-DevStack</a>.
